h1. SimpleQueues

In the Gang of Four books, one of the first few lines is "Program to an interface, not an implementation." When you need a queue, the only operations you need are enqueue and dequeue. It doesn't matter that Redis (a nice and simple queue server when you need it) has all kinds of operations available.

This library was written and spec'd on Ruby 1.9.2. It's so small it should work anywhere the Redis gem works.

h2. Exceptions

All underlying exceptions the Redis gem raises are let through: no extra exceptions are raised. This means you'll see <code>Errno::ECONNREFUSED</code>, <code>Errno::EAGAIN</code> and friends.

h2. Usage

<pre><code>require "simple_queues"
Queues = SimpleQueues::Redis.new

Queues.enqueue :pages_to_crawl, :url => "http://blog.teksol.info"
Queues.enqueue :pages_to_crawl, :url => "http://techcrunch.com"

# In another process

loop do
  message = Queues.dequeue_blocking :pages_to_crawl
  process(message)
end

# Alternatively, using a timeout
loop do
  message = Queues.dequeue_with_timeout :pages_to_crawl, 5 # seconds
  if message then
    process(message)
  else
    # Timed out
  end
end
<code></pre>

h1. Multiple Queues

Sometimes, you want to dequeue from multiple queues simultaneously, and react appropriately. When that happens, you need to use <code>#on_dequeue</code>:

<pre><code>require "simple_queues"
Queues = SimpleQueues::Redis.new

$running = true
Queues.on_dequeue :crawler_controls do |message|
  $running = false if message["command"] == "quit"
end

Queues.on_dequeue :pages_to_crawl do |message|
  # Handle crawling a page
end

while $running do
  Queues.dequeue_with_timeout 5 #seconds
end
</code></pre>
